# **ü•ï Vision**

We want to build the future of Web3 on real people.

Today, many Web3 companies focus solely on technical solutions for user acquisition and engagement, but we believe that a lasting community requires not just interaction, but also emotion, fun, and connection.

Our vision is to create a Web3 universe where users are not just addresses, but participants, competitors, creators, and members of a community. In this universe, companies will reach people directly through the World App, engaging them with gamified experiences, rewarding them, and integrating them into their ecosystems.

Our goal is to build a Web3 community that is always active, creative, and truly made up of real people. Because it‚Äôs not growing chains, but connected humans that create real impact.

# **Innovation Highlights**

Our core philosophy is to harness the power of Web3 without exposing its inherent complexities to the end-user. We believe the future of Web3 adoption lies in creating intuitive, seamless experiences that feel familiar to Web2 users. Our platform is built on this vision, offering a unique solution in a market where applications often struggle to be both entertaining and effective at onboarding users into the decentralized world.

We bridge this gap by creating an ecosystem that not only contributes to the growth of Web3 but also provides a tangible value proposition to our users through a robust reward system.

### Core Technologies & User Experience

We achieve our vision through a carefully selected technology stack designed for security, scalability, and unparalleled ease of use.

- üîê **Human Verification with World ID:** We leverage World ID's "Proof of Personhood" protocol to ensure every user is a unique human. This is fundamental to our vision of creating a fair and high-quality user experience, eliminating bots and securing the integrity of our reward system. The integration is seamless, validating humanity without compromising user privacy.
- üîë **Effortless Onboarding with Privy SDK:** We eliminate the steep learning curve typically associated with Web3. Using Privy, users can sign in with familiar methods like email or social accounts, while a non-custodial wallet is automatically generated for them in the background. This caters to both crypto-native users and complete newcomers, making the first step into Web3 as simple as logging into a standard application.
- üèÜ **Guaranteed Rewards via Smart Contracts:** All user rewards are managed and distributed through transparent, audited Smart Contracts on the blockchain. This ensures that rewards are not just a promise but a guarantee, secured by immutable code. It builds trust and demonstrates the true power of decentralized ownership to our users.

### Market Differentiation & Extensibility

- **A New Market Solution:** Unlike competitors who focus either on onboarding or entertainment, our platform successfully merges both. We offer a fun, engaging experience that subtly introduces users to Web3 technologies and allows them to earn real value, creating a powerful and sustainable adoption loop.
- **Built for Integration & Scalability:** Our modular architecture is designed for the future. It allows for easy extensibility and straightforward integration with new protocols, platforms, and partners, ensuring our ecosystem can continuously evolve and grow.
- **A Versatile Suite of Engagement Tools**: We empower businesses with a comprehensive toolkit for community interaction, far beyond simple giveaways.

# **Why It‚Äôs Needed & What We Offer**

The biggest challenge for Web3 ecosystems is acquiring new users and keeping existing communities active without relying on costly and inefficient Web2 advertising.

As Carrot, we solve this problem at its core.

Our platform enables companies to use their marketing budgets to directly fuel community growth. We attract new users to their ecosystems and keep current users active with tangible rewards. This creates a win-win scenario where companies achieve their goals, and users are rewarded for their participation and engagement.

In short, we transform money wasted on inefficient ads into a powerful engine for ecosystem growth.

### The Problem

Web3 projects struggle with a critical growth dilemma:

- **High User Acquisition Costs:** Traditional advertising is expensive and ineffective at attracting genuine, long-term users.
- **Low Community Engagement:** Standard airdrops and giveaways are boring, attract bots, and fail to build a loyal community.
- **Pervasive Bot Attacks:** Sybil attacks drain marketing budgets and devalue rewards for real participants.
- **High Barrier to Entry:** Complex wallets, gas fees, and technical jargon scare away mainstream users.
- **Lack of Trust:** Users are skeptical of reward promises due to rampant scams and unfulfilled commitments.

### The Solution

**Carrot** solves the community management problem at its root by replacing boring and inefficient methods with fun and rewarding experiences. Our platform enables companies to reach the enthusiastic and loyal audience they seek by keeping users active in the ecosystem while providing them with real earnings and a sense of purpose. We build this on four core pillars:

1.  **Bot-Free & Fair Environment:** By using **World ID**'s "Proof of Personhood" protocol, we guarantee that every participant is a real and unique human, not a fake account. This creates a fair competitive environment and ensures that rewards go to the right people, completely eliminating bot attacks.
2. **Effortless & Instant Onboarding:** With our **Privy** integration, we break down one of the biggest barriers in Web3. Users can log in within seconds using familiar methods like email or social accounts, without the hassle of complex wallet setups or memorizing seed phrases. A secure wallet is automatically created for them in the background, allowing them to take their first step into Web3 seamlessly.
3.  **Transparent & Guaranteed Rewards:** We overcome the trust issue with the transparency of the blockchain. Companies lock the entire prize pool into our audited **Smart Contracts** at the start of a campaign. This proves to all participants that the rewards are not just a promise but a guarantee secured by immutable code. Winners receive their rewards automatically and instantly.
4.  **Fun & Gamified Experiences:** Instead of monotonous airdrops, we offer dynamic and interactive tools that encourage active user participation. With real-time quizzes, multi-step quests, and creative developer challenges, we turn passive observers into active participants who enjoy being part of the ecosystem.

### Use Cases

Carrot offers a flexible and powerful toolkit for various actors in the Web3 space. Here are some examples of how the platform can be used to achieve different goals:

** DeFi Protocol Launch and Token Distribution**

- **Company's Goal:** A new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol wants to educate potential users about its features (e.g., lending, swapping) and fairly distribute its new governance token to a broad base.
- **Carrot's Solution:** The company organizes a quiz using the **"Live Quiz Mode"** about how the protocol works. They fill the prize pool with their new tokens and select the **"Rain Drop" üåßÔ∏è** mode for fair distribution.
- **User's Gain:** By participating in the quiz, users both learn about the protocol and earn the project's governance token for their correct answers. This gives them an early stake and the opportunity to participate in the project's governance.

** Community Growth for an NFT Project**

- **Company's Goal:** An NFT project wants to create hype before its mint, grow its social media channels (Twitter, Discord), and deepen the community's connection to the project's lore.
- **Carrot's Solution:** The project uses the **"Interactive Quests"** module. It creates a multi-step quest chain asking users to: "Follow us on Twitter," "Join our Discord server," "Answer the name of the main character in our story," and "Visit our mint page."
- **User's Gain:** Users who successfully complete all tasks earn a reward in `USDC` or `WLD`, or even more valuable, a "Whitelist" spot for the upcoming mint.

** Building a Developer Ecosystem for a Layer 2 Chain**

- **Company's Goal:** A new Layer 2 blockchain wants to encourage talented developers to build applications on its chain without the high costs and organizational burden of a physical hackathon.
- **Carrot's Solution:** The L2 foundation launches the **"Stake & Build"** mode. It locks a large prize, such as 10,000 `USDC`, in a smart contract to be awarded to the person who develops the best decentralized application (dApp) using their SDK.
- **User's Gain:** Developers stake tokens to participate, develop and submit their projects over 21 days. The winning developer receives the grand prize, while all participating developers gain experience on the new chain and produce a project they can add to their portfolio.

** Increasing Engagement at a Web3 Conference**

- **Company's Goal:** A conference organizer wants to encourage attendees to visit sponsor booths and create a fun, interactive "treasure hunt" experience during the event.
- **Carrot's Solution:** The **"Interactive Quests"** module is used with QR code integration. A unique QR code is placed at each sponsor booth. The quest requires attendees to visit 5 different booths and scan these codes.
- **User's Gain:** Attendees use the scanner within the Carrot mini-app (via World App) to collect the QR codes. Once they've collected all the codes, they can claim a reward, such as exclusive event merchandise or a small amount of `WLD`.

## System Architecture
